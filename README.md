💝 Hi! You can call me Fluffz.

   ✿ A little bit of JavaScript.
   
   ✿ HTML.
   
   ✿ CSS.

   ✿ And some tiny bits and bobs of Solidity.
   
🎨 My hobbies include:

   ✦ Art (Traditional and digital drawing!)
   
   ✦ Writing (Mostly fictional)
   
   ✦ Watching fun movies (Animation is my favourite!)

   ★ Cats! (I'm an Aliurophile.)
